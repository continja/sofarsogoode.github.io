Get warm, cozy and snuggle up to see our 2021 Christmas show!<!--more--> We still have some setup/changeover-from-Halloween work to do, but should be live on/around Thanksgiving.

Be sure to review the [Rules for Viewing](/the_rules) and be mindful of blocking our neighbors' driveways or views of their holiday setups.

## Location

We’re located in the Anderson Mill West area of Cedar Park, just north of Austin, TX.

## Showtimes

**Dates:** 

Starting Friday, Nov 26 (the day after Thanksgiving)

**Times:**

ON-DEMAND between sunset and 11pm.

That's right. When you arrive after dark, if the show is not already playing, you'll see information scrolling on the garage door with instructions for sending a text message that will start the show just for you. This way, you don't have to worry about arriving at any particular 'show time', the show isn't playing if no one is there to watch, and if you do arrive mid-show, you can restart it yourself right away with no need to wait.

This is an experiment, so we'll see how it works and adjust accordingly.

**Duration:** Entire show lasts about 35 minutes.

<div class="notice--warning">Because there are plenty of opportunities to view the show, if you cannot find a place to park safely and without disturbing traffic, please plan to return another time.</div>
