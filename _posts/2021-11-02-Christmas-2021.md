Get warm, cozy and snuggle up to see our 2021 Christmas show!<!--more--> We still have some setup/change-over-from-Halloween work to do, but should be live on/around Thanksgiving.

Be sure to review the [Rules for Viewing](/the_rules) and be mindful of blocking our neighbors' driveways or views of their holiday setups.

## Location

We’re located in the Anderson Mill West area of Cedar Park, just north of Austin, TX.

## Showtimes

**Dates:** 

Starting Friday, Nov 26 (the day after Thanksgiving).

**Times:**

ON-DEMAND between sunset and 11pm.

That's right. When you arrive after dark, if the show is not already playing, you'll see information scrolling on the garage door with instructions for sending a text message to trigger playing just for you. You don't have to worry about arriving at any particular 'show time', the show isn't playing if no one is there to watch, and if you do arrive mid-show, you can trigger it yourself as soon as it finishes with no need to wait.

This is an experiment, so we'll see how it works and adjust accordingly.

**Duration:** Entire show lasts about 45 minutes, but is divided into 2 sets of about 20 minutes each.

<div class="notice--warning">Because there are plenty of opportunities to view the show, if you cannot find a place to park safely and without disturbing traffic, please plan to return another time.</div>

## How to Hear the Music

Tune to **87.9 FM** on your car or portable radio.

## The Playlists

The full show is divided into 2 alternating sets of 6 different songs each. Texting the trigger command will start whichever set is queued to play next. 

So, you can watch one set then either trigger the next immediately or, if you've had enough for one night, come back to watch the other set another time.

<div class="notice--info"><strong>Secret Tip:</strong> You can also specify which set you want to watch by appending a "1" or "2" to the end of the trigger command.</div>

<div class="notice--warning">To avoid having random Internet people abuse this and trigger the show when not actually here, you have to visit in-person to get the number and trigger command... which may change periodically if necessary.</div>
