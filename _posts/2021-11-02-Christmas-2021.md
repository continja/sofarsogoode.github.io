Christmas is over, but you can still see the show through Jan 9.

## Location

We’re located in the Anderson Mill West area of Cedar Park, just north of Austin, TX.

## Showtimes

**Dates:** 

We're live **now** through Jan 9, 2022!

**Times:**

ON-DEMAND between sunset and 11pm.

That's right. When you arrive after dark, if the show is not already playing, you'll see information scrolling on the garage door with instructions for sending a text message to start the show. You don't have to worry about arriving at any particular 'show time' and, if you do arrive mid-show, you can trigger it again as soon as it finishes with no need to wait.

This is an experiment, so we'll see how it works and adjust accordingly.

<div class="notice--warning">Be aware that it's first come, first served and you can't interrupt a currently playing set.</div>

**Duration:** Entire show lasts about 45 minutes, but is divided into 2 sets of about 20 minutes each.

<div class="notice--warning">Because there are plenty of opportunities to view the show, if you cannot find a place to park safely and without disturbing traffic, please plan to return another time.</div>

## How to Hear the Music

Tune to **87.9 FM** on your car or portable radio.

## The Playlists

With Christmas now behind us, but New Year's Eve just a few days away, I changed up the sets. 

By default, texting "GO" starts the NYE show, which is basically all the non-Christmas songs from the Christmas Show. Texting "GOXMAS" will play just the Christmas Songs.

<div class="notice--warning">To avoid having random Internet people abuse this and trigger the show when not actually here, you have to visit in-person to get the number.</div>
