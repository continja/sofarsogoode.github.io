## Showtimes

**Dates:** 

We're live **now** through Jan 9, 2022!

**Times:**

ON-DEMAND between sunset and 11pm.

That's right. When you arrive after dark, if the show is not already playing, you'll see information scrolling on the garage door with instructions for sending a text message to start the show. You don't have to worry about arriving at any particular 'show time' and, if you do arrive mid-show, you can trigger it again as soon as it finishes with no need to wait.

This is an experiment, so we'll see how it works and adjust accordingly.

<div class="notice--warning">Be aware that it's first come, first served and you can't interrupt a currently playing set.</div>

**Duration:** Entire show lasts about 45 minutes, but is divided into 2 sets of about 20 minutes each.

<div class="notice--warning">Because there are plenty of opportunities to view the show, if you cannot find a place to park safely and without disturbing traffic, please plan to return another time.</div>

## How to Hear the Music

Tune to **87.9 FM** on your car or portable radio.

## The Playlists

The full show is divided into 2 alternating sets. Texting the trigger command will start whichever set is queued to play next. 

So, you can watch one set then either trigger the next immediately or, if you've had enough for one night, come back to watch the other set another time.

<div class="notice--info"><strong>Secret Tip:</strong> You can also specify which set you want to watch by appending a "1" or "2" to the end of the trigger command.</div>

<div class="notice--warning">To avoid having random Internet people abuse this and trigger the show when not actually here, you have to visit in-person to get the number and trigger command... which may change periodically if necessary.</div>
