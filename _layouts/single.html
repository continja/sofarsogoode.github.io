	{% include head.html %}

	<body>
		<p>So, what does this look like with just the head.html, no content, then the footer?<p>
		<p>Think I can move things around so I can use a post/single layout to display something like a blog post? I wonder if I can convert these includes into layouts to give me a few more options.</p>
